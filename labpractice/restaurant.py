vegan=str(input("are you a vegan?"))
gf=str(input("do you prefer gluten free?"))

if veg=="yes":
	if vegan=="yes":
		if gf=="yes":
			print("your restaurant choice is CORNER CAFE (or) THE CHEFS KITCHEN")

if veg=="no":
	if vegan=="no":
		if gf=="no":
			print("your restaurant choice is JOES GOURMET BURGERS")
if veg=="yes":
